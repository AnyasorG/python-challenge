# PyBank - Financial Analysis

This Python script analyzes financial data from a budget_data.csv file and calculates important financial metrics, such as the total number of months, net total amount of Profit/Losses, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have:
- Python installed on your system. 
- Install visual studio code (optional) and git bash (Windows user)

Additionally, you should have a CSV file named "budget_data.csv" with the following columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

## How to Use the python script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Python script.

2. Ensure you have the required CSV file ("budget_data.csv") in the same directory as the Python script, or update the 'csvpath' variable to specify the correct file path.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

4. Run the Python script using the following command:

    python main.py

    The script will analyze the financial data and display the results on the terminal. It will also create a text file named "financial_analysis.txt" in the "analysis" directory within the same directory.

    Review the analysis results on the terminal and in the "financial_analysis.txt" file.

Output Format

The analysis results include the following information:

    Total number of months
    Net total amount of Profit/Losses
    Average change
    Greatest increase in profits
    Greatest decrease in profits

Output File

The results are saved in a text file named "financial_analysis.txt" in the "analysis" directory. You can find the detailed financial analysis in this file.
